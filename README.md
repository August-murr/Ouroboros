# Ouroboros  
**Exploring full-stack optimization for AI systems**

Ouroboros is an **early-stage research project** studying how an AI agent might participate in the iterative improvement of *every part* of its AI stack, not just neural network parameters.

Today, “training” usually means optimizing weights, while everything else  
(models, pipelines, tools, data strategies, evaluation frameworks, agentic logic, etc.)  
is manually engineered.

Ouroboros investigates whether this entire stack can be made **optimizable**,  
with an AI agent proposing structured modifications and evaluating outcomes in a controlled loop.

This repository is experimental and exploratory; its ideas may change significantly.

## **Core Idea**

This project follows a Bitter Lesson–style methodology:  

**minimize human involvement** (except for safety and privacy), **maximize flexibility**, and **convert every component of the system to something that can be optimized by compute**.  

The goal is to transform problems into forms where scalable search, automation, and computation can operate with minimal human assumptions or hand-crafted tweaks. 

Rather than relying on human intuition about the “right way” to build AI systems, the methodology prioritizes **open-ended exploration, broad possibility spaces, and solutions discovered through scale**.
